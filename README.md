### 42KL Cursus Project 5

**Score: 125/125**

In this project, I implemented quick sort with the specific instructions <br/>
To get the maximum scores for sorting 100 and 500 numbers, optimizations were needed <br/>
The thresholds are < 700 instructions for 100 numbers and < 5500 instructions for 500 numbers <br/>
My average moves are 685 for 100 numbers and 5163 for 500 numbers (out of 100 tests)
